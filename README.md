# MazeWorldFoundryVTT
A project that aims to bring the MazeWorld TTRPG to FoundryVTT

## Development

The structure is pretty much following [Git Flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/), and please if you're interested, get in touch and just try to follow common sense?

This is not really organized.
